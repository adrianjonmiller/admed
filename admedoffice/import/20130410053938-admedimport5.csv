The close interaction of both features in Sorbion Sachet S guarantees effective preparation for the wound bed and regulation of the wound conditions. This is what makes Sorbion Sachet S so effective at accelerating healing. Sorbion Sachet S is particularly suitable as a primary dressing for moderately to heavily exudating wounds and is especially useful in combination with the Carolon Multi-layer Stocking System and other compression modalities for management of exudate caused by venous insufficiency. The strong osmotic effect of Sorbion Sachet S guarantees rapid absorption of wound exudate with tremendous absorption capacity without drying out the wound. Microorganisms and cell debris are flushed from the depths of the wound and captured in Sorbion Sachet S.  Sorbion Sachet S is very effective for moderately to heavily exudating wounds.

At its core is a super-absorbent polymer that allows the dressing to help re-define the category of highly absorbent.  Many other absorbent dressings rely on spaces within the dressings to fill with fluid but XTRASORB's super-absorbent polymer binds to fluid and converts to a gel. The distinct advantages this offers over traditional dressings are: 
XTRASORB dressings are able to hold more fluid and lock fluid inside the dressing which helps to decrease the risk of maceration.  The dressings come in a variety of sizes and can be used on an assortment of chronic and acute wounds including:

Hydrofera Blue is intended for use on complex wounds and has shown excellent results in trials for treatment of wounds (Pyoderma - radiation burns - chemical burns - venous stasis ulcers - yeast infections - folliculitis - infected wounds). Hydrofera Blue can be used to provide a safe moist environment for optimum wound healing on non-infected wounds. Hydrofera Blue is highly absorptive. In addition to being bacteriostatic the Hydrofera Blue open cell structure provides capillary vacuum action to draw excess fluid and exudate from the wound bed. Hydrofera Blue must be moistened with sterile saline or sterile water then squeezed out and secured to the wound bed with an appropriate secondary dressing. Hydrofera Blue is incredibly soft and comfortable for the patient (must be kept moist). Other attributes of Hydrofera Blue include gentle self-debridement of necrotic tissue and pain relief. Hydrofera Blue also provides odor control through prevention of the growth of odor-causing bacteria on the sponge. Hydrofera Blue dressings should be changed every 1 to 3 days following good wound care practice.

TRANSEAL is highly permeable to gases and moisture vapor which allows the skin to breathe and moisture to transmit from the site.  It is impermeable to water and bacteria. External contaminants are prevented from reaching the wound site. TRANSEAL has an easy and two-step delivery system. TRANSEAL uses a carrier film that maintains the integrity of the dressing and ensures proper application every time. The carrier film is transparent which allows for accurate positioning over the wound site.  It can be used as a tracing device to document wound measurements.  TRANSEAL has been developed to have a very high moisture vapor transmission rate. A high MVTR will reduce the pooling of drainage under the film that can cause infection at the site or maceration of the peri-wound skin. TRANSEAL will allow moisture to transmit from the wound site at a faster rate but will keep the site moist enough to maintain an environment conducive to healing.,,Transeal Wound Dressing,,,,,http://www.woundsource.com/files/woundsource/product-images/transealr_deroyal.jpg,
